Hey guys, welcome back to another video. From now on, market updates will be done on Fridays, which allows me to collect data over the entire week since we’ll be looking at more things. So, let’s dive into what’s happening in the general market — covering volumes, rejections, diesel prices, capacity insights, and ELP violation data. After that, we’ll dig into specifics for flatbeds, reefers, and dry vans. What’s going on in the spot market? How is it changing week over week? Ready? Let’s go.

First off, let’s look at the general overview. The total market volume—not just the spot market—decreased by 2.32% week over week. General rejections across the whole market also fell significantly, by 10.02%, bringing rejection rates down to 5.84%. Spot volumes took a hit too, falling about 7.6%, and spot rates across all equipment types dropped roughly 4 cents per mile.

Now onto diesel prices. Unfortunately, they’re creeping up: week over week, diesel is about a cent more per gallon than last week, and month over month it’s risen by nearly 6 cents. However, on a year-over-year basis, diesel is still about 9 to 10 cents cheaper than it was at this time last year.

Looking at the map data—which you can explore yourself on my website under the latest market data—you’ll see California, Oregon, and Washington continue to have the highest pump prices for diesel. The East Coast is also on the pricey side, while Oklahoma and Mississippi currently offer the cheapest diesel. Again, you can play with this diesel price map on my website.

Switching gears to capacity, I’ve started making my own charts using FMCSA data divided by week. This week is week 30. The total number of authorities gained dropped from the previous week, and the total authorities lost also decreased. Because these are inversely related, the net carriers gained also went down. Right now, net carriers are about 17 gained this week. For a clearer picture, last week showed about 200 gained. Keep in mind there’s a discrepancy between my data and Sonar’s because I calculate from Friday to Thursday and exclude Canadian authorities, broker authorities, and permits — I’m only counting U.S.-based carriers. So again, 17 net carriers gained this week.

Next, let’s focus on ELP out-of-service data—how many out-of-service orders have been issued over time. The data as of July 23rd shows that date had the highest number of out-of-service orders issued for lack of English language proficiency. The trend seems to be rising. The question is, what percentage of carriers get out-of-service orders versus violations? Excluding border zone carriers who aren’t supposed to get out-of-service orders but can get violations, on July 23rd only about 60% of those carriers received out-of-service orders, with the rest getting violations. Since June 25th, there have been times when it hit 100%, but two days ago, it was 60%. So, many carriers are getting violations without being put out of service.

Now, on the maps showing capacity and out-of-service data, starting with the out-of-service heat map updated monthly as of July 3rd, most ELP out-of-service orders happen in Wyoming, followed by Tennessee and Texas. Interestingly, some states like California apparently do not place folks out of service, but we’ll see as more data comes in.

Regarding authorities being issued, Texas leads by far, followed by California, Florida, and Illinois. I update this data almost daily.

Moving on to dry vans, reefers, and flatbeds in the spot market, according to FTR Intel: dry vans saw a 4 cent per mile decrease week over week. Year over year, dry van rates are about 2.6% lower on the spot market. Volumes dropped 8.4% week over week and are 6% lower year over year. Looking at volumes week over week, dry van volumes are down on the spot market, with most loads still coming out of Texas and California.

Regarding the load-to-truck ratio, it became a bit lighter week over week. Wyoming and South Dakota saw a decrease. Right now, states with better load-to-truck ratios include California, South Carolina, and New Jersey. But be cautious—those states might be surrounded by overcapacity, meaning many deadheading trucks dilute the ratio.

For reefers, rates also dropped 4 cents per mile week over week on the spot market, about 1% lower than last year. Volumes fell 13.5% week over week and are 17% lower year over year. The map shows volumes going down, but the majority of reefer loads still originate from California, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and some in Georgia.

Load-to-truck ratios for reefers changed quite a bit, with some areas like North Dakota and South Dakota getting darker (meaning better ratios), while others like Arkansas got lighter. Delaware stands out with about 8.5 loads per truck, but again, surrounded by overcapacity due to deadheading trucks. The key takeaway: always compare load-to-truck ratio maps with volume maps. For example, North Dakota might have a high ratio but not enough loads, so you’re at the mercy of whether loads show up or not.

Flatbeds experienced a similar 4 cent per mile decrease on the spot market week over week. Year over year, rates are about 0.4% lower. Volumes dropped 5.4% week over week but remain 21% higher than this time last year. The volume map shows dwindling loads, though Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, California, Florida, and Georgia still have more flatbed or open deck trailer loads, with Texas dominating.

Load-to-truck ratios for flatbeds worsened overall, with lighter maps, though Washington got slightly darker, indicating improvement there. Mississippi continues to have the highest load-to-truck ratio, along with Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama.

In terms of real-world experience versus data, I had an interesting week because one of my trucks ended up in the Rockies—Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado. Despite being in a tough area, we secured really good rates by ignoring where loads were going and booking the highest possible gross and rate per mile. Sometimes that’s the only way to make it work when stuck in a dead area with crazy deadhead miles and the next load won’t cover the deadhead.

The end of the week was tough because weekend loads are hard to book from dead areas and need to pay well. It took a while to find the right load. But overall, I hope you like this new market update format. If you have questions, let me know. Otherwise, I’m curious how your week went. Have a fantastic weekend—stay safe, stay healthy, and keep learning. See you in the next video!
